(Verse 1: Calculus 3)
Yo, I'm diving into dimensions, Calculus 3 my new extension
Multivariable's the session, from 3D graphs to gradients no question
Partial derivatives got me stressin', but Jacobians giving blessings
Optimize with no confessions, on saddle points we ain't guessin'

Max and min with Lagrange, constraints that will rearrange
Surface integrals, feels strange, flux across a range
Triple integrals stackin’ cubic frames, volumes under curves proclaim
Vector fields, they're game, Stokes' Theorem no longer untamed

(Hook)
We flip the script like matrices, compute like binary factories
Jump from planes to probabilities, unleash mathematical capacities
Enter my mind's faculty, where numbers form a perfect gallery
Calculus, Algebra, Probability, the trinity of this math odyssey

(Verse 2: Linear Algebra)
Step into the world of Linear Algebra, where vectors are
