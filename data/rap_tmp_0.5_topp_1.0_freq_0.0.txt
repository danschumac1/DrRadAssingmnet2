**Verse 1: Calculus III**  
Yo, we steppin' in the realm of Calculus III,  
Multivariable functions, see 'em in 3D,  
Partial derivatives, climbin' gradients with ease,  
Optimizing surfaces, catch the breeze.

Triple integrals, volume under surfaces,  
Cylindrical, spherical, all the perfect fits,  
From Stoke's Theorem to Divergence, we ain't lax,  
Vector fields flow, no time to relax.

**Chorus**  
Math in my veins, equations on my mind,  
Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability combined,  
From vectors to matrices, and combinatorics scenes,  
We're solving the unknown, if you know what I mean.

**Verse 2: Linear Algebra**  
Shift the gear, Linear Algebra's here,  
Vectors and matrices, the concepts are clear,  
Dot products, cross, find the angle in between
