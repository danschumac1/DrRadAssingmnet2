(Verse 1: Calculus 3)
Yo, dive into dimensions, we're beyond just two,
Calculus 3, a journey for the brave and few.
Vectors, planes in space, moving with finesse,
Partial derivatives, optimizing success.

Triple integrals over cylindrical domains,
Flux through surfaces, through these mathematical terrains.
Gradient vectors point the way to climb,
Maximizing profit in minimum time.

(Chorus)
We stackin' equations like they’re blocks,
Solving mysteries in this math paradox.
Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability scenes,
Master these numbers, rule the world of means.

(Verse 2: Linear Algebra)
Step up to matrices and vectors in line,
Linear transformations defining the design.
Determinants unravel the volume context,
Eigenvalues whisper future prospects.

Dot products project shadows so neat,
Orthogonal bases underpinning your feet.
From R^n to complex fields we roam,
Linear algebra – it's our mathematical home.

(Chorus
